<p> I'm sure you've heard all the excitement about the new Star Wars movie, "The Force Awakens." I'm sorry I couldn't wait to watch it with you because I'm away at school. All of my roomates were going so I didn't want to be left out! I hope you understand... To make up for being a bad sister, I reviewed the movie and created this website so you could find out what I thought and so you could learn a little bit more about the movie until you can convince Mom to take you! </p>
